U. Manber and G. Myers. Suffix arrays: A new method for on-line string searches



There are 2 file descriptors, file1 and file2 defined in lines 28 and 29. (main.cpp)
file1 is the input file
file2 is the output file

STDIN is possible too.

It is compiled with
g++ main.cpp code.cpp

and run with
./a.out < {input_file}.txt

Input file :
First line contains T, which is the number of test cases
The subsequent T lines each contain one substring to be searched for.
